Chess Skills Prototype.

The prototype would show the Skills animations for the developers to see how it looks in Web and Mobile.

## Prompt Plan

The full prompt plan lives at `docs/prompts/skills-motion.md`.

## ELI5: What to do next

1) Open `docs/prompts/skills-motion.md`.
2) Copy the prompts from top to bottom, one at a time, into your AI tool.
3) After each prompt, save the output before moving to the next prompt.
4) If something looks wrong, go back one prompt and add a short fix (e.g., "match the Figma spacing and colors").
5) When you finish all prompts, you should have the full UI + animations for the Skills flow.
